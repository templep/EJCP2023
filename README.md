# EJCP2023
a repo for material used at EJCP 2023 in Valence (July 2023)

The session was focusing on the reproducibility of results and empirical Software Engineering (SE).
The first part was taken care of by Prof. Mathieu Acher
and this repo is about the second half of the day and proposes to focus on reproducibility and Machine Learning (ML).

Slides that come back to the basics of ML are available in the Presentation folder.
The TP folder contains material that was used during the practical session.
Note that this practical session can be ran in multiple ways.
It uses Python (3.xx) and Scikit-learn, a library that provides various different ML algorithms and implementations.
We provide a jupyter notebook to run again in a controlled environment (so jupyter-lab and jupyter-notebook can be used).
To make it even easier, jupyterLite (https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) is also available and run everything in the web.
You just have to clone this repo and import the TP material in the jupyterLite session.
# Make sure that the data (heart.csv) and the notebook are in the same folder or change the path to load the data in the notebook.
